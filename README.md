# Password Generator

This assignment gave me the task of creating a password generator. This application needed to use prompts for password criteria, the length must be between 8-128 characters, and at least one of the criteria needed to be selected. I used conditional statements to specify the block of code to be executed. In addition, I used arrays to construct lists and strings to store text.
 
The criteria:
 
##### uppercase letters
##### lowercase letters
##### numbers from 0-9
##### symbols
 
The user must confirm a password containing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The user needs to select at least one of these criteria. The password was generated randomly using array data, math.random and math.floor.
